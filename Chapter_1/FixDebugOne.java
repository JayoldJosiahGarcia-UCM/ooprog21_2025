/*
 Bugs:
 1. Wrong syntax on line 1 class name FixDebug One has space on it, it should be FixDebugOne.
 2. Wrong syntax on line 3, Main was Upper Cased instead of Lower one(main). 
 3. Method parameter should have square brackets it should be `String[] args` instead of `String args`.
 4. Systm is also misspelled, should be System.
 5.Missing semicolon at the end of the println statement.
